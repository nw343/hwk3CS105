Here is my first file

I am adding more to this file now

Here I am adding some psuedo code for N queens

// Here the psuedocode begins

// Start the method with the given column number

// Check to see if we ahve past the number of columns
   // If we have, return true

// Assumed else if the above condition not met

// Loop through until the end of the rows (0-n)
  
  //Check for non conflicting spot
  
     //If this condition is true, place the queen
     
     //Call the method for the next column
     
        //return true
        
     //Remove the queen
     
  //increment the row

//end loop across rows

//return false
  
  
  
  I am submitting this commit to a new branch to see how that goes
  
  Lets see if anyone can guess what this does
  
  //public int [] xxxxxx (int [] array1, int [] array2)
  
  // initialize method
  
    //set borrowFlag to false
    
 //check to make sure the bases are the same
 
   //if not, return null
   
//end check

//make a backup of the data

//create a solution array

//loop across first array

  //check for borrow
  
     //subtract 1 from the current array[index]
     
     //unset the borrowflag
     
  //check if array 2 [index] > array1[index]
    
    //set the borrowFlag
    
    //array1[index] = array1[index] + base;
    
  //subtract array2 digit from array1 digit. assign this value to solution at index
  
  //increment index
  
  //end loop
