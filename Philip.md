Here is my first file

I am adding more to this file now

Here I am adding some psuedo code for N queens

// Here the psuedocode begins

// Start the method with the given column number

// Check to see if we ahve past the number of columns
   // If we have, return true

// Assumed else if the above condition not met

// Loop through until the end of the rows (0-n)
  
  //Check for non conflicting spot
  
     //If this condition is true, place the queen
     
     //Call the method for the next column
     
        //return true
        
     //Remove the queen
     
  //increment the row

//end loop across rows

//return false
